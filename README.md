# Pearl Browser

Pearl Browser is a fork of the latest Firefox ESR that aims to have parity with security fixes and be auto-updating, with additional UI enhancements, uBlock by default, and restored support for modern legacy platforms like Windows 7/8.x and MacOS 10.12-10.14.

Pearl Browser is a personal passion project, I am not an experienced developer nor am I responsible for the vast majority of source code changes. Pearl Browser is ostensibly its own project, but in reality is more of a polished and complete package based on the legacy Firefox patches developed by E3kskoy7wqk. Pearl browser differs in that it is meant to be easy to use/install, while quickly auto-updating to keep users on the latest security patches. It is also based on the ESR branch of firefox, while the binaries provided by E3kskoy7wqk are based on the nightly branch.

Pearl Browser is branded and built using [Gluon](https://github.com/pulse-browser/gluon), the build framework for Pulse Browser.\
E3kskoy7wqk's [Firefox for Windows 7](https://github.com/e3kskoy7wqk/Firefox-for-windows-7) patches are responsible for Win 7/8.x legacy compatibility.

Pearl Browser is in _verrry_ early development, and most of it's core features are not yet complete. If you'd like, you can build a development version using the source in this repository that is based on Firefox 128 ESR, but the first full release will be based on Firefox 140 ESR.

Legacy MacOS compatibility is planned in the future, but not yet implimented.\
There are no current plans to support Windows XP/Vista.
